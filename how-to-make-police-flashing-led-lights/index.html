<p>I am fairly new to arduino and want to code some leds to flash and look like police lights. 1) solder the red &amp; the blue leds together individually into 2 pairs, after that solder a 22 ohm. With a large variety of lights, light bars, sirens, and speakers, led outfitters is proud to provide police officers with the best products in the industry. The leds are forced to flash at a rapid rate (adjustable) simultaneously as they shift sequentially at the outputs of the ic 4017.</p>
