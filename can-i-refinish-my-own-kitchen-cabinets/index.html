Can You Reface Metal Kitchen You Can Reface Kitchen From giulliagianfellice.blogspot.com
Applying polyurethane over the stained surface is the easiest part when it comes to refinishing kitchen cabinets without stripping them. Refinishing these hardy cabinets, instead of replacing them, can both conserve wood and money. Refinishing cabinets is generally more affordable than refacing, however, refacing is about 30% to 50% of the cost to replace the cabinets entirely. The real difference between painting (or refinishing) and refacing your cabinets is relatively straight forward.
